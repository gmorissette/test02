“I don’t think I’ve ever wanted inner peace,” I typed to Eloise on Facebook Chat. “Inner warfare just seems so much better.”
Waiting for her response, I drank green tea from a paper cup. I didn’t feel good nor bad, but neither, like a tree. It was June something, twenty-ten-something, and I was sitting alone at a round table near a window inside one of Montreal’s many Starbucks. It was bright and sunny outside. The air-conditioned Starbucks, in comparison, seemed weatherless, like a kind of non-season. Near me, a teenager of Asian descent was playing a space combat video game about explosions being beautiful, and on the wall in front of me was a banal painting of a red fish. “Who painted this?” I thought, abstractly focusing on the eye and the mouth. “Salvador Dali,” I thought. “Just kidding,” I thought.
The future, as usual, seemed dark. I was a “freelance web designer,” which sounded okay, but essentially meant “70 unemployed.” I was also a “new media artist” making conceptual videos that I shared online or presented at exhibits, which was only vaguely getting me anywhere. I had spent the past few months feeling deeply uninspired, unable to come up with anything, not even a simple tweet, just passively staring at my computer screen like it was some sort of hypnotic lawn ornament.
Trying to create art videos was now a source of anxiety, as opposed to an outlet for it. 
Because of this, procrastinating my own work by aimlessly browsing the internet felt more calming than usual, like a meditation retreat. I wasn’t sure where all my usual creative thoughts had gone, if they had escaped my skull like feral animals into the night and were now somewhere else in the world, moving around in packs, rampaging suburban yards maybe, or if I had just exhausted every possible thought I could have as this person, in this environment.
“Creative dry spell,” I thought.
“Same,” typed Eloise on Facebook Chat after a long absence. “Sorry I’ve been unresponsive. I just got absorbed in replying to this email.”
“It’s okay,” I typed. “How’s Baltimore?” 

My dream job was not having a job.


Strategically late by about an hour, I met up with Grace and her friends at a “modern” Mexican-themed restaurant. It was a week later and Ashlyn’s birthday, who was turning 24. She was wearing a white knee-length dress decorated with random splashes of colors, as if fireworks had exploded on it. Next to Ashlyn was her boyfriend, Roberto. I felt relieved that Roberto was present, as he usually functioned as my default “guy friend” within Grace’s friends group. “Mexican boyfriend,” I thought. “Mexican restaurant,” I thought. I couldn’t tell if these two items were connected or not.
I removed my backpack and jacket, which was wet from the rain and glistening a little. I wanted to sit at the end of the table, next to Grace and her friend Andrea, but before I could locate a chair, Ashlyn’s mom, Diane, who was visiting from Newfoundland, and who I had never met, got up and gestured to indicate that she wanted a hug, probably because I was one of Ashlyn’s friends. “It’s my mom,” said Ashlyn, laughing. Hugging Diane, I became overly aware that I hadn’t really been around people in almost three days, hadn’t even felt once, in that period of time, the need to socialize with other human beings. 
I hugged Ashlyn’s mom as a way of forcing myself to get into a social mood and Diane said, “Oh, he’s a hugger” and I replied, “I am a hugger.” Then Diane returned to her seat and we weren’t talking anymore and didn’t interact again for the rest of the evening.
